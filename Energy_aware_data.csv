vadonka,lge-kernel-kang,"Linux 3.0.31 (cherry picked from commit bea37381fd9a34c6660e5195d31beea86aa3dda3) nfs: Enclose hostname in brackets when needed in nfs_do_root_mount commit 98a2139f4f4d7b5fcc3a54c7fddbe88612abed20 upstream. When hostname contains colon (e.g. when it is an IPv6 address) it needs to be enclosed in brackets to make parsing of NFS device string possible. Fix nfs_do_root_mount() to enclose hostname properly when needed. NFS code actually does not need this as it does not parse the string passed by nfs_do_root_mount() but the device string is exposed to userspace in /proc/mounts.

Current APIC code assumes MSR_IA32_APICBASE is present for all systems. Pentium Classic P5 and friends didn't have this MSR. MSR_IA32_APICBASE was introduced as an architectural MSR by Intel @ P6. Code paths that can touch this MSR invalidly are when vendor == Intel && cpu-family == 5 and APIC bit is set in CPUID - or when you simply pass lapic on the kernel command line, on a P5. The below patch stops Linux incorrectly interfering with the MSR_IA32_APICBASE for P5 class machines. Other code paths exist that touch the MSR - however those paths are not currently reachable for a conformant P5.

This reverts commit a32744d4abae24572eff7269bc17895c41bd0085. While that commit was technically the right thing to do, and made the x86-64 compat mode work identically to native 32-bit mode (and thus fixing the problem with a 32-bit systemd install on a 64-bit kernel), it turns out that the automount binaries had workarounds for this compat problem. Now, the workarounds are disgusting: doing an ""uname()"" to find out the architecture of the kernel, and then comparing it for the 64-bit cases and fixing up the size of the read() in automount for those. And they were confused: it's not actually a generic 64-bit issue at all, it's very much tied to just x86-64, which has different alignment for an 'u64' in 64-bit mode than in 32-bit mode. But the end result is that fixing the compat layer actually breaks the case of a 32-bit automount on a x86-64 kernel. There are various approaches to fix this (including just doing a ""strcmp()"" on current->comm and comparing it to ""automount""), but I think that I will do the one that teaches pipes about a special ""packet mode"", which will allow user space to not have to care too deeply about the padding at the end of the autofs packet. That change will make the compat workaround unnecessary, so let's revert it first, and get automount working again in compat mode. The packetized pipes will then fix autofs for systemd.

In xen_restore_fl_direct(), xen_force_evtchn_callback() was being called even if no events were pending.

This seems to give a significant performance benefit for some workloads. There is some subtle tricksy ""..since the check here is trying to check both pending and masked in a single cmpw, but I think this is correct.

This loop on EBCISR register was designed to clear IRQ sources before enabling a DMA channel. This register is clear-on-read so a race condition can appear if another channel is already active and has just finished its transfer.

Newer BKDG[1] versions recommend a different initialization value for the running average range register in the northbridge. This improves the power reading by avoiding counter saturations resulting in bogus values for anything below about 80% of TDP power consumption. Updated BIOSes will have this new value set up from the beginning, but meanwhile we correct this value ourselves. This needs to be done on all northbridges, even on those where the driver itself does not register at. This fixes the driver on all current machines to provide proper values for idle load.

postgres,postgres,"Improve control logic for bgwriter hibernation mode. Commit 6d90eaaa89a007e0d365f49d6436f35d2392cfeb added a hibernation mode to the bgwriter to reduce the server's idle-power consumption. However, its interaction with the detailed behavior of BgBufferSync's feedback control loop wasn't very well thought out. That control loop depends primarily on the rate of buffer allocation, not the rate of buffer dirtying, so the hibernation mode has to be designed to operate only when no new buffer allocations are happening. Also, the check for whether the system is effectively idle was not quite right and would fail to detect a constant low level of activity, thus allowing the bgwriter to go into hibernation mode in a way that would let the cycle time vary quite a bit, possibly further confusing the feedback loop. To fix, move the wakeup support from MarkBufferDirty and SetBufferCommitInfoNeedsSave into StrategyGetBuffer, and prevent the bgwriter from entering hibernation mode unless no buffer allocations have happened recently. In addition, fix the delaying logic to remove the problem of possibly not responding to signals promptly, which was basically caused by trying to use the process latch's is_set flag for multiple purposes. I can't prove it but I'm suspicious that that hack was responsible for the intermittent ""postmaster does not shut down"" failures we've been seeing in the buildfarm lately. In any case it did nothing to improve the readability or robustness of the code. In passing, express the hibernation sleep time as a multiplier on BgWriterDelay, not a constant. I'm not sure whether there's any value in exposing the longer sleep time as an independently configurable setting, but we can at least make it act like this for little extra code.",10/05/2012 3:45,0,,

Rover-Yu,skbtrace-kernel,"tick: Add tick skew boot option Let the user decide whether power consumption or jitter is the more important consideration for their machines. Quoting removal commit af5ab277ded04bd9bc6b048c5a2f0e7d70ef0867: ""Historically, Linux has tried to make the regular timer tick on the various CPUs not happen at the same time, to avoid contention on xtime_lock. Nowadays, with the tickless kernel, this contention no longer happens since time keeping and updating are done differently. In addition, this skew is actually hurting power consumption in a measurable way on many-core systems."" Problems: - Contrary to the above, systems do encounter contention on both xtime_lock and RCU structure locks when the tick is synchronized. - Moderate sized RT systems suffer intolerable jitter due to the tick being synchronized. - SGI reports the same for their large systems. - Fully utilized systems reap no power saving benefit from skew removal, but do suffer from resulting induced lock contention. - 0209f649 rcu: limit rcu_node leaf-level fanout This patch was born to combat lock contention which testing showed to have been _induced by_ skew removal.

freebsd,freebsd,"Implement my first cut at filtered frames in aggregation sessions. The hardware can optionally ""filter"" frames if successive transmissions to a given node (ie, ""entry in the keycache"") fail. That way the hardware can implement a kind of early abort of all the other frames queued to that destination, rather than simply trying to TX each frame to that destination (and failing.) The background: * If a frame comes back as being filtered, the hardware didn't try to TX it (or it was outside the TX burst opportunity.) So, take it as a hint that some (but not all, see below) frames to the destination may be filtered. * If the CLRDMASK bit is set in a TX descriptor, the ""filter to this destination"" bit in the keycache entry is cleared and TX to that host will be unconditionally retried. * Right now everything has the CLRDMASK bit set, so filtered frames tend to be aggregates and frames that fall outside of the WME burst window. It was a bit worse in the past as I had messed up the TX flags and CLRDMASK wasn't being set on aggregate frames. The annoying bits: * It's easy (ish) to do for aggregate session frames - firstly, they can be retried in any order as long as they're within the BAW, and there's already a bunch of infrastructure tracking how many frames the TID has queued to the hardware (tid->hwq_depth.) However, for frames that bypassed the software queue, hwq_depth doesn't get incremented. I'll fix that in a subsequent commit. * For non-aggregate session frames, the only retries that can occur are ones for sequence numbers that hvaen't successfully been TXed yet. Since there's no re-ordering going on in non-aggregate sessions, if any subsequent seqno frames make it out, any filtered frames before that seqno need to be dropped. Hence why this initially is just for aggregate session frames. * Since there may be intermediary frames to the destination that have CLRDMASK set - for example, any directly dispatched management frames to that destination - it's possible that there will be some filtered frames followed up by some non filtered frames. Thus, it can't be assumed that once you see a filtered frame for the given destination node, all subsequent frames for all TIDs will be filtered. Ok, with that in mind: * Create a per-TID filtered frame queue for frames that the hardware returns as filtered. * Track filtered frames per-tid, rather than per-node. It just makes the locking much easier. * When a filtered frame appears in the completion function, the node transitions to ""filtered"", and all subsequent completed error frames (filtered or otherwise) are put on the filtered frame queue. The TID is paused once (during the transition from non-filtered to filtered). * If a filtered frame retry count exceeds SWMAX_RETRIES, a BAR should be sent. * Once all the frames queued to the hardware for the given filtered frame TID, transition back from filtered frame to non-filtered frame, which means pre-pending all the filtered frames onto the head of the software queue, clearing the filtered frame state and unpausing the TID. Things get quite hairy around handling completion (aggr, non-aggr, norm, direct-dispatched frames to a hardware queue); whether it's an ""error"", ""cleanup"" or ""BAR"" state as well as filtered, which order to do things in (eg do filtered BEFORE checking for BAR, as the filter completion may be needed to actually transmit a BAR frame.) This work has definitely reminded me that I have to tidy up all the locking and remove some of the ridiculous lock/unlock/lock/unlock going on in the completion functions. It's also reminded me that I should really split out TID versus hardware TXQ locking, even if the underlying locking is still the destination hardware TXQ. Finally, this is all pre-requisite for working on AP mode power save support (PS-POLL, uAPSD) as well as improving performance to misbehaving nodes (as they can transition into filter mode, stopping any TX until everything has caught up.) Finally (ish) - this should also be done for non-aggregate sessions as there are still plenty of laptops and mobile devices that don't speak 802.11n but do wish for stable, useful power save AP support where packets aren't simply dropped. This requires software retransmission for non-aggregate sessions to be implemented, which includes the caveats I've mentioned above. Finally finally - this doesn't yet do anything about the CLRDMASK bit in the TX descriptor. That's still unconditionally set to 1. I'll debug the current work (mostly ensuring I haven't busted up the hairy transitions between BAR, filtered, error (all frames in an aggregate failing) and cleanup (when transitioning from aggregation -> non-aggregation.)) Finally finally finally - this is all original work by yours truely, rather than ported from the Atheros internal driver codebase or Linux ath9k.

freebsd,freebsd,"Map the non-QoS TID to the voice queue, in order to ensure important things like EAPOL frames make it out. After a whole bunch of hacking/testing, I discovered that they weren't being early-dropped by the stack (but I should look at ensuring that later..) but were even making to the hardware transmit queue. They were mostly even being received by the remote end. However, the remote end was completely ignoring them. This didn't happen under 150-170MBit TCP tests as I'm guessing the TX queue stayed very busy and the STA didn't do any scanning. However, when doing 100Mbit/s of TCP traffic, the STA would do background scanning - which involves it coming in and out of powersave mode with the AP. Now, this is a total and utter hack around the real problems, which are: * I need to implement proper power save handling and integrate it into the filtered frames support, so the driver/stack doesn't send frames whilst the station is actually in sleep; * .. but frames were actually making it to the STA (macbook pro) and the AP did receive an ACK; but a tcpdump on the receiving side showed the EAPOL frame never made it. So the stack was dropping it for some reason; * Importantly - the EAPOL frames are currently going into the non-QoS TID, which maps to the BE queue and is susceptible to that queue being busy doing other things, but; * There's other traffic going on in the non-QoS TID from other contexts when scanning is going on and it's possible there's some races causing sequence number/IV issues, but; * Importantly importantlly, I think the interaction with TID 16 multicast traffic in power save mode is causing issues - since I -believe- the sequence number space being used by the EAPOL frames on TID 16 overlaps with the multicast frames that have sequence numbers allocated and are then stuffed on the cabq. Since with EAPOL frames being in TID 16 and queued to the BE queue, it's going to be waiting to be serviced with all of the aggregate traffic going on - and if the CABQ gets emptied beforehand, those TID 16 multicast frames with sequence numbers will go out beforehand. Now, there's quite likely a bunch of ""stuff happening slightly out of sequence"" going on due to the nature of the TX path (read: lots of overlapping and concurrent ath_start() and ath_raw_xmit() calls going on, sigh) but I thought I had caught them all and stuffed each TID TX behind a lock (that lasted as long as it needed to in order to get the frame onto the relevant destination queue - thus keeping things in order.) Unfortunately the last problem is the big one and I'm going to stare at it some more. If it _is_ So this is a work around for now to ensure that EAPOL frames actually make it out before any other stuff in the non-QoS TID and HOPEFULLY before the CABQ gets active. I'm now going to spend a little time in the TX path figuring out exactly why the sender is rejecting things. There's two (well, three if you count EAPOL contents invalid) possibilities: * The sequence number is out of order (ie, something else like the multicast traffic on CABQ) is going out first on TID 16; * The CCMP IV is out of order (similar to above - but less likely, as the TX key for multicast traffic is different to unicast traffic); * EAPOL contents strangely invalid.

As always, turbostat never writes any MSRs. turbostat's default display now includes Watts for hardware that supports RAPL: [root@sandy]# turbostat cor CPU %c0 GHz TSC %c1 %c3 %c6 %c7 %pc2 %pc3 %pc6 %pc7 Pkg_W Cor_W GFX_W 0.07 0.80 2.29 0.13 0.00 0.00 99.80 0.43 0.00 0.72 98.16 3.49 0.12 0.14 0 0 0.14 0.80 2.29 0.12 0.00 0.00 99.74 0.43 0.00 0.72 98.16 3.49 0.12 0.14 0 4 0.04 0.80 2.29 0.22 1 1 0.06 0.80 2.29 0.08 0.00 0.00 99.86 1 5 0.03 0.80 2.29 0.10 2 2 0.17 0.80 2.29 0.14 0.00 0.00 99.69 2 6 0.03 0.79 2.29 0.28 3 3 0.03 0.80 2.29 0.07 0.00 0.00 99.90 3 7 0.04 0.80 2.29 0.06 The Pkg_W column shows Watts for each package (socket) in the system. On multi-socket systems, the system summary on the 1st row shows the total. The Cor_W column shows Watts due to processors cores. Core_W is included in Pkg_W. The optional GFX_W column shows Watts due to the graphics ""un-core"". GFX_W is included in Pkg_W. The optional PKG_% column shows the % of time in the measurement interval that RAPL power limiting is in effect. Note that the RAPL energy counters have some limitations. First hardware updates the countesr about once every milli-second. This is fine for typical turbostat measurement intervals > 1 sec. However, when turbostat is used to measure events that approach 1ms, the counters are less useful. Second, the energy counters are 32-bits long and subject to wrapping. For example, the counter increments in 15 micro-Joule units on my local server, and the part could (in theory) consume energy at its TDP specification of 130 Watts. Here the 32-bit Joule counter coult wrap as soon as 8 minutes. Turbostat detects and handles up to 1 counter overflow per interval. But when the measurement interval exceeds the guaranteed counter range, we can't detect if more than 1 overflow occured. So in this case turbostat indicates that the results are in question by replacing the fractional part of the result with ""**"": Pkg_W Cor_W GFX_W 3** 0** 0** Third, the RAPL counters are energy (Joule) counters -- they sum up weighted events in the package to estimate energy consumed. They are not analong power (Watt) meters. In practice, they tend to under-count because they don't cover every possible use of energy in the package. Also, the accuracy of the RAPL counters will vary between product generations, and between SKU's in the same product generation. turbostat's -v option now displays per-Package Thermal Design Power (TDP). This is the specification for the part's maximum power consumption. eg. on a 2-package SNB-Xeon system: cpu0: 130.00 Watts Pkg Thermal Design Spec cpu8: 130.00 Watts Pkg Thermal Design Spec Finally, turbostat's -R option enables decoding and output of all RAPL registers on turbostat startup.

lenb,linux,"tools/power turbostat: v3.0: monitor Watts and Temperature Show power in Watts and temperature in Celsius when hardware support is present. Intel's Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge processor generations support RAPL (Run-Time-Average-Power-Limiting). Per the Intel SDM (Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manual) RAPL provides hardware energy counters and power control MSRs (Model Specific Registers). RAPL MSRs are designed primarily as a method to implement power capping. However, they are useful for monitoring system power whether or not power capping is used. In addition, Turbostat now shows temperature from DTS (Digital Thermal Sensor) and PTM (Package Thermal Monitor) hardware, if present. As before, turbostat reads MSRs, and never writes MSRs. New columns are present in turbostat output: The Pkg_W column shows Watts for each package (socket) in the system. On multi-socket systems, the system summary on the 1st row shows the sum for all sockets together. The Cor_W column shows Watts due to processors cores. Note that Core_W is included in Pkg_W. The optional GFX_W column shows Watts due to the graphics ""un-core"". Note that GFX_W is included in Pkg_W. The optional RAM_W column on server processors shows Watts due to DRAM DIMMS. As DRAM DIMMs are outside the processor package, RAM_W is not included in Pkg_W. The optional PKG_% and RAM_% columns on server processors shows the % of time in the measurement interval that RAPL power limiting is in effect on the package and on DRAM. Note that the RAPL energy counters have some limitations. First, hardware updates the counters about once every milli-second. This is fine for typical turbostat measurement intervals > 1 sec. However, when turbostat is used to measure events that approach 1ms, the counters are less useful. Second, the 32-bit energy counters are subject to wrapping. For example, a counter incrementing 15 micro-Joule units on a 130 Watt TDP server processor could (in theory) roll over in about 9 minutes. Turbostat detects and handles up to 1 counter overflow per measurement interval. But when the measurement interval exceeds the guaranteed counter range, we can't detect if more than 1 overflow occured. So in this case turbostat indicates that the results are in question by replacing the fractional part of the Watts in the output with ""**"": Pkg_W Cor_W GFX_W 3** 0** 0** Third, the RAPL counters are energy (Joule) counters -- they sum up weighted events in the package to estimate energy consumed. They are not analong power (Watt) meters. In practice, they tend to under-count because they don't cover every possible use of energy in the package. The accuracy of the RAPL counters will vary between product generations, and between SKU's in the same product generation, and with temperature. turbostat's -v (verbose) option now displays more power and thermal configuration information -- as shown on the turbostat.8 manual page. For example, it now displays the Package and DRAM Thermal Design Power (TDP): cpu0: MSR_PKG_POWER_INFO: 0x2f064001980410 (130 W TDP, RAPL 51 - 200 W, 0.045898 sec.) cpu0: MSR_DRAM_POWER_INFO,: 0x28025800780118 (35 W TDP, RAPL 15 - 75 W, 0.039062 sec.) cpu8: MSR_PKG_POWER_INFO: 0x2f064001980410 (130 W TDP, RAPL 51 - 200 W, 0.045898 sec.) cpu8: MSR_DRAM_POWER_INFO,: 0x28025800780118 (35 W TDP, RAPL 15 - 75 W, 0.039062 sec.)

The only sane thing to do (whether anything in that code can be called remotely sane is debatable) is to special case fpscr and handle it as a separate statement. I initially tried to do it it by making the array access conditional to index < PT_FPSCR and using a 3rd else leg but for some reason gcc was unable to understand it and still spewed the warning.

Previously, this was okay because 0 @delay short-circuited to queue_work() before doing anything with delayed_work. 8852aac25e moved 0 @delay test into __queue_delayed_work() after sanity check on delayed_work making megaraid trigger BUG_ON(). Although megaraid is already fixed by c1d390d8e6 (""megaraid: fix BUG_ON() from incorrect use of delayed work""), this patch converts BUG_ON()s in __queue_delayed_work() to WARN_ON_ONCE()s so that such abusers, if there are more, trigger warning but don't crash the machine.

This causes excessive pruning of emergency memory pools without any good reason. Additionaly, on ARM architecture any driver which is using dmapools will sooner or later trigger the following error: ""ERROR: 256 KiB atomic DMA coherent pool is too small! Please increase it with coherent_pool= kernel parameter!"". Increasing the coherent pool size usually doesn't help much and only delays such error, because all GFP_ATOMIC DMA allocations are always served from the special, very limited memory pool. This patch changes the dmapool code to correctly use gfp flags provided by the dmapool caller.

This fixes a regression in 3.7-rc, which has since gone into stable. Commit 00442ad04a5e (""mempolicy: fix a memory corruption by refcount imbalance in alloc_pages_vma()"") changed get_vma_policy() to raise the refcount on a shmem shared mempolicy; whereas shmem_alloc_page() went on expecting alloc_page_vma() to drop the refcount it had acquired. This deserves a rework: but for now fix the leak in shmem_alloc_page(). Hugh: shmem_swapin() did not need a fix, but surely it's clearer to use the same refcounting there as in shmem_alloc_page(), delete its onstack mempolicy, and the strange mpol_cond_copy() and __mpol_cond_copy() - those were invented to let swapin_readahead() make an unknown number of calls to alloc_pages_vma() with one mempolicy; but since 00442ad04a5e, alloc_pages_vma() has kept refcount in balance, so now no problem.

Add a quirk to correctly report battery capacity on 2010 and 2011 Lenovo Thinkpad models. The affected models that I tested (x201, t410, t410s, and x220) exhibit a problem where, when battery capacity reporting unit is mAh, the values being reported are wrong. Pre-2010 and 2012 models appear to always report in mWh and are thus unaffected. Also, in mid-2012 Lenovo issued a BIOS update for the 2011 models that fixes the issue (tested on x220 with a post-1.29 BIOS). No such update is available for the 2010 models, so those still need this patch. Problem description: for some reason, the affected Thinkpads switch the reporting unit between mAh and mWh; generally, mAh is used when a laptop is plugged in and mWh when it's unplugged, although a suspend/resume or rmmod/modprobe is needed for the switch to take effect. The values reported in mAh are *always* wrong. This does not appear to be a kernel regression; I believe that the values were never reported correctly. I tested back to kernel 2.6.34, with multiple machines and BIOS versions. Simply plugging a laptop into mains before turning it on is enough to reproduce the problem. Here's a sample /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/info from Thinkpad x220 (before a BIOS update) with a 4-cell battery: present: yes design capacity: 2886 mAh last full capacity: 2909 mAh battery technology: rechargeable design voltag ...",20/12/2012 23:49,0,,

dannomac,freebsd,"Bring over my initial work from the net80211 TX locking branch. This patchset implements a new TX lock, covering both the per-VAP (and thus per-node) TX locking and the serialisation through to the underlying physical device. This implements the hard requirement that frames to the underlying physical device are scheduled to the underlying device in the same order that they are processed at the VAP layer. This includes adding extra encapsulation state (such as sequence numbers and CCMP IV numbers.) Any order mismatch here will result in dropped packets at the receiver. There are multiple transmit contexts from the upper protocol layers as well as the ""raw"" interface via the management and BPF transmit paths. All of these need to be correctly serialised or bad behaviour will result under load. The specifics: * add a new TX IC lock - it will eventually just be used for serialisation to the underlying physical device but for now it's used for both the VAP encapsulation/serialisation and the physical device dispatch. This lock is specifically non-recursive. * Methodize the parent transmit, vap transmit and ic_raw_xmit function pointers; use lock assertions in the parent/vap transmit routines. * Add a lock assertion in ieee80211_encap() - the TX lock must be held here to guarantee sensible behaviour. * Refactor out the packet sending code from ieee80211_start() - now ieee80211_start() is just a loop over the ifnet queue and it dispatches each VAP packet send through ieee80211_start_pkt(). Yes, I will likely rename ieee80211_start_pkt() to something that better reflects its status as a VAP packet transmit path. More on that later. * Add locking around the management and BAR TX sending - to ensure that encapsulation and TX are done hand-in-hand. * Add locking in the mesh code - again, to ensure that encapsulation and mesh transmit are done hand-in-hand. * Add locking around the power save queue and ageq handling, when dispatching to the parent interface. * Add locking around the WDS handoff. * Add a note in the mesh dispatch code that the TX path needs to be re-thought-out - right now it's doing a direct parent device transmit rather than going via the vap layer. It may ""work"", but it's likely incorrect (as it bypasses any possible per-node power save and aggregation handling.) Why not a per-VAP or per-node lock? Because in order to ensure per-VAP ordering, we'd have to hold the VAP lock across parent->if_transmit(). There are a few problems with this: * There's some state being setup during each driver transmit - specifically, the encryption encap / CCMP IV setup. That should eventually be dragged back into the encapsulation phase but for now it lives in the driver TX path. This should be locked. * Two drivers (ath, iwn) re-use the node->ni_txseqs array in order to allocate sequence numbers when doing transmit aggregation. This should also be locked. * Drivers may have multiple frames queued already - so when one calls if_transmit(), it may end up dispatching multiple frames for different VAPs/nodes, each needing a different lock when handling that particular end destination. So to be ""correct"" locking-wise, we'd end up needing to grab a VAP or node lock inside the driver TX path when setting up crypto / AMPDU sequence numbers, and we may already _have_ a TX lock held - mostly for the same destination vap/node, but sometimes it'll be for others. That could lead to LORs and thus deadlocks. So for now, I'm sticking with an IC TX lock. It has the advantage of papering over the above and it also has the added advantage that I can assert that it's being held when doing a parent device transmit. I'll look at splitting the locks out a bit more later on. General outstanding net80211 TX path issues / TODO: * Look into separating out the VAP serialisation and the IC handoff. It's going to be tricky as parent->if_transmit() doesn't give me the opportunity to split queuing from driver dispatch. See above. * Work with monthadar to fix up the mesh transmit path so it doesn't go via the parent interface when retransmitting frames. * Push the encryption handling back into the driver, if it's at all architectually sane to do so. I know it's possible - it's what mac80211 in Linux does. * Make ieee80211_raw_xmit() queue a frame into VAP or parent queue rather than doing a short-cut direct into the driver. There are QoS issues here - you do want your management frames to be encapsulated and pushed onto the stack sooner than the (large, bursty) amount of data frames that are queued. But there has to be a saner way to do this. * Fragments are still broken - drivers need to be upgraded to an if_transmit() implementation and then fragmentation handling needs to be properly fixed. Tested: * STA - AR5416, AR9280, Intel 5300 abgn wifi * Hostap - AR5416, AR9160, AR9280 * Mesh - some testing by monthadar@, more to come.",08/03/2013 20:30,0,,

This means either: 1. requesting or releasing qdss clocks for every save and restore or 2. leaving the qdss clocks on all the time or 3. using the CP14 interface which is based on just the ETM clock and doesn't require the qdss clocks We choose to use CP14 interface to avoid the pitfalls for 1. and 2. above. Moreover, we make the save-restore autodetect the debug and trace architecture and do the needful based on it and hence consolidate the code for 8660 and 8960.

This is necessary to prevent CPU_DEAD and CPU_DEAD_FROZEN notifiers from executing until the CPU is fully collapsed. Otherwise, some drivers may turn off hardware resources before it is safe to do so. For example, acpuclock-8960's hotplug handler turns off CPU clocks as part of CPU_DEAD. If this happens before the collapse is complete, it may result in a hang. The call to msm_pm_wait_cpu_shutdown() will return immediately for hotplugs that do not involve power-collapse and therefore has no impact for those scenarios.

This inadvertently invalidates data next to the pen_release variable which could be bad. Fix the pointer math to only invalidate or clean the region for the pen_release variable.

During the hotplug path the secondary core will be in wfi and only an interrupt will be able to bring the core out. Removing the wfe effectively lowers the hotplug latency.

They also don't try to invalidate the cache on a spurious wakeup and report how many spurious wakeups there were. Let's do the same in our code so that we can remove our dependence on the dmac_{inv,flush}_range() functions (which are no longer upstream) and easily report spurious wakeups to the kernel logs. This does delay the time we set the pen back to its default value, but that doesn't actually matter because generic ARM hotplug code already waits for a completion before continuing.

Samsung is NOTORIOUS for screwing up power_profile - we've seen tuna power_profile values on Exynos devices as an example. Among the obvious problems with the commit that is being reverted: Missing 1.4 and 1.6 GHz entries on a device that supports operation at those frequencies. Missing cpu.awake value to handle wakelock power calculation (this was added a long time ago by one of the CM maintainers, prior to the file being forked and copied to multiple repos).

RAZR-K-Devs,android_kernel_motorola_omap4-common,"OMAP: CPU: CPUFREQ: CLOCK: VOLTAGE: LPDD: BOARD: PM: Several fixes for stability to run an stable OPP frequency table with 10 - 12 OPPs. Prior to this commit we changed vp_timeout to u8 to allow boot OMAP with more than 7 OPPs. While browsing the mach-omap2 folder I found some mistakes from ealier commits and fixed these. In my testing phase with the new OPP table I faced random crashes/reboots which were related to voltage/sr calibration rule. Now trying the kernel with including these fixes. We may switch partly or completely to EMIF or SR_CLASS 1.5 if we can't get this to work. Work left to do: USB might be unstable related to usb performance boost mode - Not the boost is the problem but the voltage calibration, so whether we have to fix SR/switch to static voltages (but this may cause higher power consumption, possibly it also helps to set single OPPs to fixed, non-scalabe voltage) - or remove the variable usb performance mode and set a fixed frequency value (600mhz min/max). In current kexec kernel we are facing an issue which causes the user cpufreq policy to be reset to kernel default in suspend/idle mode. This can be simply override by user setting an app dependant frequency lock. This issue also causes the @default_available rule for OPPs to be not effective. As we want to limit the default max frequency at 1.0GHZ we have to solve this problem or just define a new rule in omap2plus-cpufreq.c to prevent policy auto-reset.",25/05/2013 0:58,0,,

See hostapd.conf. * Add support for IEEE 802.11v Time Advertisement mechanism with UTC TSF offset. See hostapd.conf for config info. * Delay STA entry removal until Deauth/Disassoc TX status in AP mode. This allows the driver to use PS buffering of Deauthentication and Disassociation frames when the STA is in power save sleep. Only available with drivers that provide TX status events for Deauth/ Disassoc frames (nl80211). * Allow PMKSA caching to be disabled on the Authenticator. See hostap.conf config parameter disable_pmksa_caching. * atheros: Add support for IEEE 802.11w configuration. * bsd: Add support for setting HT values in IFM_MMASK. * Allow client isolation to be configured with ap_isolate. Client isolation can be used to prevent low-level bridging of frames between associated stations in the BSS. By default, this bridging is allowed. * Allow coexistance of HT BSSes with WEP/TKIP BSSes. * Add require_ht config parameter, which can be used to configure hostapd to reject association with any station that does not support HT PHY. * Add support for writing debug log to a file using ""-f"" option. Also add relog CLI command to re-open the log file. * Add bridge handling for WDS STA interfaces. By default they are added to the configured bridge of the AP interface (if present), but the user can also specify a separate bridge using cli command wds_bridge. * hostapd_cli: - Add wds_bridge command for specifying bridge for WDS STA interfaces. - Add relog command for reopening log file. - Send AP-STA-DISCONNECTED event when an AP disconnects a station due to inactivity. - Add wps_config ctrl_interface command for configuring AP. This command can be used to configure the AP using the internal WPS registrar. It works in the same way as new AP settings received from an ER. - Many WPS/WPS ER commands - see WPS/WPS ER sections for details. - Add command get version, that returns hostapd version string. * WNM: Add BSS Transition Management Request for ESS Disassoc Imminent. Use hostapd_cli ess_disassoc (STA addr) (URL) to send the notification to the STA. * Allow AP mode to disconnect STAs based on low ACK condition (when the data connection is not working properly, e.g., due to the STA going outside the range of the AP). Disabled by default, enable by config option disassoc_low_ack. * Add WPA_IGNORE_CONFIG_ERRORS build option to continue in case of bad config file. * WPS: - Send AP Settings as a wrapped Credential attribute to ctrl_iface in WPS-NEW-AP-SETTINGS. - Dispatch more WPS events through hostapd ctrl_iface. - Add mechanism for indicating non-standard WPS errors. - Change concurrent radio AP to use only one WPS UPnP instance. - Add wps_check_pin command for processing PIN from user input. UIs can use this command to process a PIN entered by a user and to validate the checksum digit (if present). - Add hostap_cli get_config command to display current AP config. - Add new hostapd_cli command, wps_ap_pin, to manage AP PIN at runtime and support dynamic AP PIN management. - Disable AP PIN after 10 consecutive failures. Slow down attacks on failures up to 10. - Allow AP to start in Enrollee mode without AP PIN for probing, to be compatible with Windows 7. - Add Config Error into WPS-FAIL events to provide more info to the user on how to resolve the issue. - When controlling multiple interfaces: - apply WPS commands to all interfaces configured to use WPS - apply WPS config changes to all interfaces that use WPS - when an attack is detected on any interface, disable AP PIN on all interfaces * WPS ER: - Show SetSelectedRegistrar events as ctrl_iface events. - Add special AP Setup Locked mode to allow read only ER. ap_setup_locked=2 can now be used to enable a special mode where WPS ER can learn the current AP settings, but cannot change them. * WPS 2.0: Add support for WPS 2.0 (CONFIG_WPS2) - Add build option CONFIG_WPS_EXTENSIBILITY_TESTING to enable tool for testing protocol extensibility. - Add build option CONFIG_WPS_STRICT to allow disabling of WPS workarounds. - Add support for AuthorizedMACs attribute. * TDLS: - Allow TDLS use or TDLS channel switching in the BSS to be prohibited in the BSS, using config params tdls_prohibit and tdls_prohibit_chan_switch. * EAP server: Add support for configuring fragment size (see fragment_size in hostapd.conf). * wlantest: Add a tool wlantest for IEEE802.11 protocol testing. wlantest can be used to capture frames from a monitor interface for realtime capturing or from pcap files for offline analysis. * Interworking: Support added for 802.11u. Enable in .config with CONFIG_INTERWORKING. See hostapd.conf for config parameters for interworking. * Android: Add build and runtime support for Android hostapd. * Add a new debug message level for excessive information. Use -ddd to enable. * TLS: Add support for tls_disable_time_checks=1 in client mode. * Internal TLS: - Add support for TLS v1.1 (RF ...",13/07/2013 18:30,0,,

dazer,ShadowCraft-Engine,"5.4 Sub Tweaks (Unoptimized and Experimental) - Fixed energy consumption when opening from stealth. - Set ShD pooling to use an adv_param, default to 10 below max. - Tweaking swing resets. - Slightly lower Shadowmeld usage. - Ambush from CDs better accounts for the opening sequence of events. That is, it accounts for the fact that not every CD is blown at the pull. - Shadow Dance now relies on a loop to gauge APS. Better handles smaller time intervals. - FW uptime better handles opening sequence of events like Ambush now does. - Autoattack's FW weight was fixed to support AoC. - t16 4pc Accounts for overlap. - THINGS TO NOTE: Ambush damage might still be a little high? Either the ambush buff didn't go through, the FW modifier is broken still, people aren't pooling before ShD properly (and I'm struggling to see the failures), or there's still a bug with the APS.

It used to be within 1/1000s, but sometimes it's a bit more on this OS. Changing the tolerance to 1/100s makes the tests pass, and I don't see any problem with it. I've read that one of Mavericks' major design goals was to improve memory efficiency, and apparently the process scheduler tries very hard to juggle time slices around to make slices abut (to amortize the power efficiency of the Intel chips, which have to ramp up and down a bit when there's processor activity). It wouldn't surprise me if this ends up making usleep just a bit less consistent in precisely how long it will be before the process wakes up again. How's that for a hypothesis?",28/10/2013 5:40,0,,

johngarchie,xmas-icetube,"Sleep code more robust against crystal problems If the crystal oscillator is nonfunctional, the system will sleep, but never wake for the once-per-second interrupt. This could make debugging a bad crystal oscillator difficult, because the system would seem to be dead. Furthermore, because the sleep code is extremely power efficient, the system can run off power stored in the capacitor for minutes, so removing the battery and external power will not reset the system right away. And if clock power is stored before the capacitors are drained, the clock will appear to be dead. To address the issue, the watchdog timer now remains on for the first five seconds. After waking five times (once per second), the crystal oscillator is probably working stably, so only then is the watchdog disabled to save power.",23/11/2013 5:22,0,,

This assumption is wrong, basically the driver should not consider any state of registers after it comes out of low power. However driver can keep the part of the IP powered up if its a wake up source. But it can not assume the register state of the IP. Also its possible that SOC glue layer can take the power off the IP if its not wake-up source to reduce the power consumption.

pinkflozd,android_kernel_motorola_msm8226,"mm: use up free swap space before reaching OOM kill Recently, Luigi reported there are lots of free swap space when OOM happens. It's easily reproduced on zram-over-swap, where many instance of memory hogs are running and laptop_mode is enabled. He said there was no problem when he disabled laptop_mode. The problem when I investigate problem is following as. Assumption for easy explanation: There are no page cache page in system because they all are already reclaimed. 1. try_to_free_pages disable may_writepage when laptop_mode is enabled. 2. shrink_inactive_list isolates victim pages from inactive anon lru list. 3. shrink_page_list adds them to swapcache via add_to_swap but it doesn't pageout because sc->may_writepage is 0 so the page is rotated back into inactive anon lru list. The add_to_swap made the page Dirty by SetPageDirty. 4. 3 couldn't reclaim any pages so do_try_to_free_pages increase priority and retry reclaim with higher priority. 5. shrink_inactlive_list try to isolate victim pages from inactive anon lru list but got failed because it try to isolate pages with ISOLATE_CLEAN mode but inactive anon lru list is full of dirty pages by 3 so it just returns without any reclaim progress. 6. do_try_to_free_pages doesn't set may_writepage due to zero total_scanned. Because sc->nr_scanned is increased by shrink_page_list but we don't call shrink_page_list in 5 due to short of isolated pages. Above loop is continued until OOM happens. The problem didn't happen before [1] was merged because old logic's isolatation in shrink_inactive_list was successful and tried to call shrink_page_list to pageout them but it still ends up failed to page out by may_writepage. But important point is that sc->nr_scanned was increased although we couldn't swap out them so do_try_to_free_pages could set may_writepages. Since commit f80c0673610e (""mm: zone_reclaim: make isolate_lru_page() filter-aware"") was introduced, it's not a good idea any more to depends on only the number of scanned pages for setting may_writepage. So this patch adds new trigger point of setting may_writepage as below DEF_PRIOIRTY - 2 which is used to show the significant memory pressure in VM so it's good fit for our purpose which would be better to lose power saving or clickety rather than OOM killing.",17/02/2014 23:35,0,,

barome,HD_mako,"time: RCU permitted to stop idle entry via softirq From: ""Paul E. McKenney"" <paul.mckenney@xxxxxxxxxx> The can_stop_idle_tick() function complains if a softirq vector is raised too late in the idle-entry process, presumably in order to prevent dangling softirq invocations from being delayed across the full idle period, which might be indefinitely long -- and if softirq was asserted any later than the call to this function, such a delay might well happen. However, RCU needs to be able to use softirq to stop idle entry in order to be able to drain RCU callbacks from the current CPU, which in turn enables faster entry into dyntick-idle mode, which in turn reduces power consumption. Because RCU takes this action at a well-defined point in the idle-entry path, it is safe for RCU to take this approach. This commit therefore silences the error message that is sometimes produced when the going-idle CPU suddenly finds that it has an RCU_SOFTIRQ to process. The error message will continue to be issued for other softirq vectors. Reported-by: Sedat Dilek <sedat.dilek@xxxxxxxxx> Signed-off-by: Paul E.

The timer is initialized right after musb is probed. There is actually no need to have this timer running because _nothing_ will happen until we have the gadget loaded. Also we need this timer only if we run in OTG mode _and_ we need it also after the gadget has been replaced with another one. I've been looking at am35x.c, da8xx.c, omap2430.c, tusb6010.c. da8xx seem to have the same problem as dsps and doing mostly the same thing. tusb6010 seem to do something different and do some actual ""idle / power saving"" work so I am not too comfortable to remove musb_platform_try_idle() from musb_gadget_setup(). Therefore this patch does not start the timer if there is no gadget active (which is at musb_gadget_setup() at time). In order to have the timer active after the gadget is loaded it will be triggered from dsps_musb_enable().

poondog,kangaroo-m7-mkIII,"ARM: add support for bit sliced AES using NEON instructions Bit sliced AES gives around 45% speedup on Cortex-A15 for encryption and around 25% for decryption. This implementation of the AES algorithm does not rely on any lookup tables so it is believed to be invulnerable to cache timing attacks. This algorithm processes up to 8 blocks in parallel in constant time. This means that it is not usable by chaining modes that are strictly sequential in nature, such as CBC encryption. CBC decryption, however, can benefit from this implementation and runs about 25% faster. The other chaining modes implemented in this module, XTS and CTR, can execute fully in parallel in both directions. The core code has been adopted from the OpenSSL project (in collaboration with the original author, on cc). For ease of maintenance, this version is identical to the upstream OpenSSL code, i.e., all modifications that were required to make it suitable for inclusion into the kernel have been made upstream. The original can be found here: http://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=6f6a6130 Note to integrators: While this implementation is significantly faster than the existing table based ones (generic or ARM asm), especially in CTR mode, the effects on power efficiency are unclear as of yet. This code does fundamentally more work, by calculating values that the table based code obtains by a simple lookup; only by doing all of that work in a SIMD fashion, it manages to perform better.

P880-dev,android_kernel_lge_x3,"mutex: dynamically disable mutex spinning at high load Date Thu, 4 Apr 2013 10:54:18 -0400 The Linux mutex code has a MUTEX_SPIN_ON_OWNER configuration option that was enabled by default in major distributions like Red Hat. Allowing threads waiting on mutex to spin while the mutex owner is running will theoretically reduce latency on the acquisition of mutex at the expense of energy efficiency as the spinning threads are doing no useful work. This is not a problem on a lightly loaded system where the CPU may be idle anyway. On a highly loaded system, the spinning tasks may be blocking other tasks from running even if they have higher priority because the spinning was done with preemption disabled. This patch will disable mutex spinning if the current load is high enough. The load is considered high if there are 2 or more active tasks waiting to run on the current CPU. If there is only one task waiting, it will check the average load at the past minute (calc_load_tasks). If it is more than double the number of active CPUs, the load is considered high too. This is a rather simple metric that does not incur that much additional overhead. The AIM7 benchmarks were run on 3.7.10 derived kernels to show the performance changes with this patch on a 8-socket 80-core system with hyperthreading off. The table below shows the mean % change in performance over a range of users for some AIM7 workloads with just the less atomic operation patch (patch 1) vs the less atomic operation patch plus this one (patches 1+3). +--------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | Workload | mean % change | mean % change | mean % change | | | 10-100 users | 200-1000 users | 1100-2000 users | +--------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | alltests | 0.0% | -0.1% | +5.0% | | five_sec | +1.5% | +1.3% | +1.3% | | fserver | +1.5% | +25.4% | +9.6% | | high_systime | +0.1% | 0.0% | +0.8% | | new_fserver | +0.2% | +11.9% | +14.1% | | shared | -1.2% | +0.3% | +1.8% | | short | +6.4% | +2.5% | +3.0% | +--------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+ It can be seen that this patch provides some big performance improvement for the fserver and new_fserver workloads while is still generally positive for the other AIM7 workloads.

dannomac,freebsd,"Fix a cleanup hang if cleanup gets called _during_ an active cleanup. During power save testing I noticed that the cleanup code is being called during a RUN->RUN state transition. It's because the net80211 stack is treating that (for reasons I don't quitey know yet) as a reassociation and this calls the node cleanup code. The reason it's seeing a RUN->RUN transition is because during active power save stuff it's possible that the RUN->SLEEP and SLEEP->RUN transitions happen so quickly that the deferred net80211 vap state code ""loses"" a transition, namely the intermediary SLEEP transition. So, this was causing the node reassociation code to sometimes be called twice in quick succession and this would result in ath_tx_tid_cleanup() to be called again. The code calling it would always call pause, and then only call resume if the TID didn't have ""cleanup_inprogress"" set. Unfortunately it didn't check if it was already set on entry, so it would pause but not call resume. Thus, paused would be called more than once (once before each entry into ath-tx_tid_cleanup()) but resume would only be called once when the cleanup state was finished. This doesn't entirely fix all of the issues seen in the cleanup path but it's a necessary first step. Since this is a stability fix, it should be merged to stable/10 at some point.

jhs,build-couchdb,"Upgrade to Erlang/OTP R16B03-1 This is due to Russell Branca's notes, attached below. There has been some discussion on what versions of Erlang CouchDB should support, and what versions of Erlang are detrimental to use. Sadly there were some pretty substantial problems in the R15 line and even parts of R16 that are landmines for CouchDB. This post will describe the current state of things and make some potential recommendations on approach. It was discovered by Basho that R15* and R16B are susceptible to scheduler collapse. There's quite a bit of discussion and information in several threads [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. So what is scheduler collapse? Erlang schedulers can be put to sleep when there is not sufficient work to occupy all schedulers, which saves on CPU and power consumption. When the schedulers that are still running go through enough reductions to pass the work balancing threshold, they can trigger a rebalance of work that will wake up sleeping schedulers. The other mechanism for sharing scheduler load is work stealing. A scheduler that does not have any work to do can steal work from other schedulers. However a scheduler that has gone to sleep cannot steal work, it has to be woken up separately. Now the real problem of scheduler collapse occurs when you take sleeping schedulers and long running NIFs and BIFs that do not report an appropriate amount of reductions. When you have NIFs and BIFs that don't report an appropriate amount of reductions, you can get into a situation where a long running function call will only show up as taking one reduction, and never hit the work balance threshold, causing that scheduler to be blocked during the operation and no additional schedulers getting woken up. I keep mentioning ""NIFs and BIFs"" because it's important to note that it is _not_ just user defined NIFs that are problematic, but also a number of Erlang BIFs that don't properly report reductions. Particularly relevant to CouchDB are the BIFs `term_to_binary` and `binary_to_term` which do _not_ behave properly, and each report a single reduction count, regardless of the size of the value passed to them. Given that every write CouchDB makes goes through `term_to_binary`, this is definitely not good. This problem is systemic to all versions of R15 and R16B. In R16B01, two changes were made to alleviate the problem. First, in `OTP-11163` `term_to_binary` now uses an appropriate amount of reductions and will yield back to the scheduler. The second important change was the introduction of the `+sfwi` (Scheduler Forced Wakeup Interval) flag [6] which allows you to specify a time interval for a new watchdog process to check scheduler run queues and wake up sleeping schedulers if need be. These two changes help significantly, although from what I understand, they do not fully eliminate scheduler collapse. *NOTE*: the `+sfwi` is _not_ enabled by default, you must specify a greater than zero time interval to enable this. *WE NEED TO ENABLE THIS SETTING.* We should figure out a way to conditionally add this to vm.args or some such. On a side note, Basho runs R15B01 because they backported the `+sfwi` feature to R15B01 [7] [8]. They recommend running with `+sfwi 500` for a 500ms interval. It might be worth testing out different values, but 500 seems like a good starting point. For Riak 2.0, they will be building against R16B03-1 and 17.0 as their set of patches to R16B02 landed in R16B03-1 [9] [10]. So R16B01 sorted out the scheduler collapse issues, but unfortunately it also broke monitors, which immediately disqualifies this release as something we should recommend to users. The issues was fixed in `OTP-11225` in R16B02. I don't know of any catastrophic problems on the order of those described above in either of these releases. Basho fixed a number of unrelated bugs in R16B02 [9] [10] that have since landed in R16B03-1, which indicates we should probably prefer R16B03-1 over R16B02. R16B03 is also disqualified because it broke SSL and `erl_syntax`, resulting in the patched R16B03-1. R14B01, R14B03, and R14B04 are known good stable releases of Erlang, and in my opinion the only known stable releases > R13 that don't present issues for CouchDB (I think R16B02/R16B03-1 are too new to declare stable yet). As for R14B02, there are some bad `ets` issues with that release. It's worth pointing out that there are two known bugs in R14B01, as Robert Newson explains: ``` There are two bugs in R14B01 that we do encounter, however. 1) Another 32/64 bit oops causes the vm to attempt to allocate huge amounts of ram (terabytes, or more) if it ever tries to allocate more than 2gib of ram at once. When this happens, the vm dies and is restarted. It???s annoying, but infrequent. 2) Sometimes when closing a file, the underlying file descriptor is *not* closed, though the erlang process exits. This is rare but still quite annoying. ``` The 17.0 release brings in a number of interesting changes to help the scheduler collapse situation. `OTP-11648` improves reduction cost and yielding of `term_to_binary`. It also utilizes `OTP-11388` which allows for NIFs and BIFs to have more control over when and how they are garbage collected (we should do some investigation on the usefulness of this for NIFs like Jiffy). The 17.0 release also updates `binary_to_term` in `OTP-11535` to behave properly with reductions and yielding similar to `term_to_binary`. This marks the 17.0 release as an important one for CouchDB as now `term_to_binary` and `binary_to_term` both behave properly. One other interesting item introduced in the 17.0 release is the concept of dirty schedulers [12] [13]. This is an experimental feature providing CPU and I/O schedulers specifically for NIFs that are known to take longer that 1ms to run. In general, we want to make sure the NIFs we use will yield and report reductions properly, but for situations where that isn't feasible, we may want to look into using dirty schedulers down the road when it's a non experimental feature. In my opinion we need to take the Erlang release issues more seriously than we currently do and provide strong recommendations to users on what versions of Erlang we support. I suggest we loosely take an approach similar to Debian, and make three recommendations: * OldStable: [R14B01, R14B03, R14B04 (NOTE: _not_ R14B02)] * Unstable: [R16B03-1 recommended, R16B02 acceptable] * Experimental: [17.0] I'm not suggesting permanently having three Erlang releases recommended like this, but it currently seems appropriate. I think long term we should target 17.x as our preferred Erlang release, and then make a CouchDB 3.0 release that is backwards incompatible with anything less than 17.0 so that we can switch over to using maps. The narrowness of the acceptable releases list is going to cause some problems. Debian Wheezy runs R15B01, which as established above, is not good to run with unless you have the `+sfwi` patch, and I'm sure there are many other distros running R15 and R16B or R16B01. I think it would be useful to users to have a set of packages with a proper Erlang CouchDB release allowing us to bless specific versions of Erlang and bundle it together, but I know this idea goes against the recent change in stance on working with distributions, and I don't know the ASF stance on this issue well enough to comment on the legality of it. That said, it does seem like the logical approach until we get a range of stable releases spread out through the distros. We need to make sure that all NIFs we use that could potentially take longer than 1ms to run properly yield and report reductions. For Jiffy, there is already a good start on this work [11]. We'll want to look into what needs to be done for the rest of the NIFs. There's quite a bit of information here, and plenty more in the footnotes, so I hope this gives a good overview of the current state of Erlang releases and helps us to make informed decisions on what approach to take with Erlang releases.

sonicxml,Popcornkernel-Tuna,"OMAP4: PM: IVA AUTO RET relaxed workaround in idle path AUTO RET for IVA VDD Cannot be permanently enabled during OFF mode due to potential race between IVA VDD entering RET and start of Device OFF mode. It is mandatory to have AUTO RET for IVA VDD exlusive with Devide OFF mode. In order to avoid lockup in OFF mode sequence, system must ensure IVA voltage domain transitions straight from stable ON to OFF. In addition, management of IVA VDD SmartReflex sensor at exit of idle path may introduce a misalignment between IVA Voltage Controller state and IVA PRCM voltage FSM based on following identified scenario: IVA Voltage Controller is woken-up due to SmartReflex management while IVA PRCM voltage FSM stays in RET in absence of any IVA module wake-up event (which is not systematic in idle path as opposed to MPU and CORE VDDs being necessarily woken up with MPU and CORE PDs). WA involves: Ensure stable ON-OFF transition for IVA voltage domain during OFF mode sequence. Ensure VCON and PRCM FSM are kept aligned due to IVA SR handling in idle path. 1) AUTO RET for IVA VDD is enabled entering in idle path, disabled exiting idle path and IVA VDD is always woken-up with a SW dummy wakeup. 2) OFF mode is enabled only in Suspend path. 3) AUTO RET for IVA VDD remains disabled in Suspend path (before OFF mode). REVISIT: Update the patch once proper Errata is out for 44xx. Benefits: 1) This patch ensures it is possible to gate SYS_CLK during OS-Idle LCD OFF when all domains are idled, saving up to 2mA at VBAT from external clock buffer. 2) IVA voltage domain is now allowed to scale to Retention during idle which reduces power consumption on all types of use case allowing extensive use of idle path (e.g.: Home screen, Page reading). Effect are especially visible if system uses Smart-Reflex Class 1.5 compared to Class 3 considering the increased difference of voltage from converged Voltage SR vs Retention voltage.

This patch modifies the walwriter process so that, when it has not found anything useful to do for many consecutive wakeup cycles, it extends its sleep time to reduce the server's idle power consumption.

It's still true that during any async commit, backends check for completed, unflushed pages of WAL and signal the walwriter if there are any; so that in practice the walwriter can get awakened and returned to normal operation sooner than the sleep time might suggest. Also, improve the checkpointer so that it uses a latch and a computed delay time to not wake up at all except when it has something to do, replacing a previous hardcoded 0.5 sec wakeup cycle. This also is primarily useful for reducing the server's power consumption when idle. In passing, get rid of the dedicated latch for signaling the walwriter in favor of using its procLatch, since that comports better with possible generic signal handlers using that latch.

TI-OpenLink,wl12xx,wl12xx: decrease elp timeout to 20ms The current elp timeout set to 200 ms is too high. While its purpose was to avoid going to ELP during Tx/Rx the problem is that it keeps the device awake also after issuing commands when there's no traffic. In Android this is a real problem as RSSI is polled by the framework every 3 seconds and keeping the chip out of ELP for 200ms each time has a significant power consumption effect. Fix that by changing to 20ms. This prevents excessive real elp sleeps and wakeups during Rx/Tx with 12xx. There's no real need any more for setting a hard coded 5ms while in forced_ps. The fw won't enter elp anyways before the dynamic-ps timeout expired as well (and it entered ps successfully).

VanirAOSP,PopcornKernel-Tuna,"omap44xx: cpuidle: Update target residencies to saner values The current values are insane. There is no possible way power saving can be attained by heading into C4 for not much more than 1ms. The average values are in the 20ms range, so why do we need to even entertain entering at much lower values when we will use more power than we save in doing so. The actual recommended values are shown in 79e796f but for some obscure reason, in 16385c7 and 22e2193 they were updated to match the exit_latency. This seems horribly wrong to me as there comes a point when the target residency is so low that you use more power actually entering the state than you gain from the insignificant amount of time you spend there. With the values in this commit, C4 state is used for >95% of the time when the screen is off, with C3 picking up the remainder. During audio playback, C4 is used ~50% of the time, C3 is used ~25% of the time and C2 picks up whatever is left.

xcstacy,kernel-Nexus4,"Clk: notifier handler for dynamic voltage scaling Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (dvfs) is a common power saving technique in many of today's modern processors. This patch introduces a common clk rate-change notifier handler which scales voltage appropriately whenever clk_set_rate is called on an affected clock. There are three prerequisites to using this feature: 1) the affected clocks must be using the common clk framework 2) voltage must be scaled using the regulator framework 3) clock frequency and regulator voltage values must be paired via the OPP library If a platform or device meets these requirements then using the notifier handler is straightforward. A struct device is used as the basis for performing initial look-ups for clocks via clk_get and regulators via regulator_get. This means that notifiers are subscribed on a per-device basis and multiple devices can have notifiers subscribed to the same clock. Put another way, the voltage chosen for a rail during a call to clk_set_rate is a function of the device, not the clock.

faux123,tuna,"mutex: dynamically disable mutex spinning at high load Date Thu, 4 Apr 2013 10:54:18 -0400 The Linux mutex code has a MUTEX_SPIN_ON_OWNER configuration option that was enabled by default in major distributions like Red Hat. Allowing threads waiting on mutex to spin while the mutex owner is running will theoretically reduce latency on the acquisition of mutex at the expense of energy efficiency as the spinning threads are doing no useful work. This is not a problem on a lightly loaded system where the CPU may be idle anyway. On a highly loaded system, the spinning tasks may be blocking other tasks from running even if they have higher priority because the spinning was done with preemption disabled. This patch will disable mutex spinning if the current load is high enough. The load is considered high if there are 2 or more active tasks waiting to run on the current CPU. If there is only one task waiting, it will check the average load at the past minute (calc_load_tasks). If it is more than double the number of active CPUs, the load is considered high too. This is a rather simple metric that does not incur that much additional overhead. The AIM7 benchmarks were run on 3.7.10 derived kernels to show the performance changes with this patch on a 8-socket 80-core system with hyperthreading off. The table below shows the mean % change in performance over a range of users for some AIM7 workloads with just the less atomic operation patch (patch 1) vs the less atomic operation patch plus this one (patches 1+3). +--------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | Workload | mean % change | mean % change | mean % change | | | 10-100 users | 200-1000 users | 1100-2000 users | +--------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | alltests | 0.0% | -0.1% | +5.0% | | five_sec | +1.5% | +1.3% | +1.3% | | fserver | +1.5% | +25.4% | +9.6% | | high_systime | +0.1% | 0.0% | +0.8% | | new_fserver | +0.2% | +11.9% | +14.1% | | shared | -1.2% | +0.3% | +1.8% | | short | +6.4% | +2.5% | +3.0% | +--------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+ It can be seen that this patch provides some big performance improvement for the fserver and new_fserver workloads while is still generally positive for the other AIM7 workloads.

SlimRoms,kernel_samsung_t1,"mutex: restrict mutex spinning to only one task per mutex Date Thu, 4 Apr 2013 10:54:17 -0400 The current mutex spinning code allow multiple tasks to spin on a single mutex concurrently. There are two major problems with this approach: 1. This is not very energy efficient as the spinning tasks are not doing useful work. The spinning tasks may also block other more important or useful tasks from running as preemption is disabled. Only one of the spinners will get the mutex at any time. The other spinners will have to wait for much longer to get it. 2. The mutex data structure on x86-64 should be 32 bytes. The spinning code spin on lock->owner which, in most cases, should be in the same 64-byte cache line as the lock->wait_lock spinlock. As a result, the mutex spinners are contending the same cacheline with other CPUs trying to get the spinlock leading to increased time spent on the spinlock as well as on the mutex spinning. These problems are worse on system with large number of CPUs. One way to reduce the effect of these two problems is to allow only one task to be spinning on a mutex at any time. This patch adds a new spinner field in the mutex.h to limit the number of spinner to only one task. That will increase the size of the mutex by 8 bytes in a 64-bit environment (4 bytes in a 32-bit environment). The AIM7 benchmarks were run on 3.7.10 derived kernels to show the performance changes with this patch on a 8-socket 80-core system with hyperthreading off. The table below shows the mean % change in performance over a range of users for some AIM7 workloads with just the less atomic operation patch (patch 1) vs the less atomic operation patch plus this one (patches 1+2). +--------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | Workload | mean % change | mean % change | mean % change | | | 10-100 users | 200-1000 users | 1100-2000 users | +--------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | alltests | -0.2% | -3.8% | -4.2% | | five_sec | -0.6% | -2.0% | -2.4% | | fserver | +2.2% | +16.2% | +2.2% | | high_systime | -0.3% | -4.3% | -3.0% | | new_fserver | +3.9% | +16.0% | +9.5% | | shared | -1.7% | -5.0% | -4.0% | | short | -7.7% | +0.2% | +1.3% | +--------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+ It can be seen that this patch improves performance for the fserver and new_fserver workloads while suffering some slight drop in performance for the other workloads.

Altaf-Mahdi,i9505,"mmc: core: Add load based clock scaling support The SD3.0/eMMC4.5/SDIO3.0 cards can support clock rates upto 200MHz (SDR104 or HS200 bus speed modes). For some workloads like video playback it isn't necessary for these cards to run at such high speed. Running at lower frequency, say 50MHz, in such cases can still meet the deadlines for data transfers. Scaling down the clock frequency dynamically has huge power savings not only because the bus is running at lower frequency but also has an advantage of scaling down the system core voltage, if supported. Provide an ondemand clock scaling support similar to cpufreq ondemand governor having two thresholds, up_threshold and down_threshold to decide whether to increase the frequency or scale it down respectively. The sampling interval is in the order of milliseconds and should be chosen by host drivers that enable MMC_CAP2_CLK_SCALE capability to take advantage of clock scaling. The sampling interval mainly depends on the the clock switching delays and hence a host driver decision. If sampling interval is too low frequent switching of frequencies can lead to high power consumption and if sampling interval is too high, the clock scaling logic would take long time to realize that the underlying hardware (controller and card) is busy and scale up the clocks.

Seems to have fixed the issue. A two core minimum allows the frequency governor to rest at 192MHz as intended. Previously, on one core, the device kept jumping up to 702MHz. If I understand the power comsumption of a processor correctly, 702MHz will use 3.5 times the power of 192MHz. Of course I now have two cores active. I assume that this is probably slightly less than double the power requirement of 192MHz on one core alone, due to some global overheads of having the chip awake.

mporsch,open80211s,"mac80211: sync method beacon alignment This synchronization method aligns TBTTs in a narrow time frame to reduce wakeup overheads in light sleep mode. Nodes using this sync method will determine the TBTT offsets between each other. Depending on the own and peers' offsets the ""steady node"" is determined. The steady node is the node with the highest TBTT offset towards the next later TBTT. Subsequently, all nodes except the steady node will gradually delay their TBTT, thus shifting towards the next later TBTT. Once a predefined offset towards this TBTT is reached, it stops shifting any further. Finally, one or multiple aligned wakeup groups are formed. Light sleep nodes benefit from waking up less times to catch all peer beacons. Since the wakeup overhead of powering up receivers and waiting for the beacon is avoided, the power consumption is reduced.

dorimanx,Dorimanx-SG2-I9100-Kernel,"rcu: Reduce cache-miss initialization latencies for large systems Commit #0209f649 (rcu: limit rcu_node leaf-level fanout) set an upper limit of 16 on the leaf-level fanout for the rcu_node tree. This was needed to reduce lock contention that was induced by the synchronization of scheduling-clock interrupts, which was in turn needed to improve energy efficiency for moderate-sized lightly loaded servers. However, reducing the leaf-level fanout means that there are more leaf-level rcu_node structures in the tree, which in turn means that RCU's grace-period initialization incurs more cache misses. This is not a problem on moderate-sized servers with only a few tens of CPUs, but becomes a major source of real-time latency spikes on systems with many hundreds of CPUs. In addition, the workloads running on these large systems tend to be CPU-bound, which eliminates the energy-efficiency advantages of synchronizing scheduling-clock interrupts. Therefore, these systems need maximal values for the rcu_node leaf-level fanout. This commit addresses this problem by introducing a new kernel parameter named RCU_FANOUT_LEAF that directly controls the leaf-level fanout. This parameter defaults to 16 to handle the common case of a moderate sized lightly loaded servers, but may be set higher on larger systems.

steev,linux,"gpt: i.MX3,5,6 GPT clock rework, now DT ""pure"", seperate sched_clock init This essentially aligns with Highbank and anything with an architected/twd timer (Cortex-A9) whereby timer initialization (i.e. clocksource/clockevent) is somewhat seperated from the setup_sched_clock call. This way multiple timers can be registered for the platform, and the more timers the better for the system (many high resolution timers firing rarely compared to one high resolution timer constantly serving events should equal lower power consumption) and the sched_clock can be set up on the more stable of those timers (on i.MX the architected timer would be preferred - so i.MX6 guys I wonder why you're not using it - but on i.MX5 this could be GPT or EPIT depending on use of the ""other"" timer type). This screws non-DT platforms as they have no way of initializing the timer anymore, but a small stub (or resurrection of mxc_timer_init) and a little split of the register function could bring it back. Caveat: on i.MX53 and i.MX6 there are two EPIT timers. How the hell do we register TWO timers as above and then pick ONE of them as a possible sched_clock source? If we convert EPIT to the same DT-pure framework like the architected or twd...?",02/01/2013 6:09,1,,

Implements the framework portion of an optional ""Pulse low battery light"" switch, which allows the pulsing low battery LED to be disabled. The function and implementation of this switch is analogous to (and borrowed from) the ""Pulse notification light"" switch. This is motivated by devices (e.g., epicmtd) featuring a battery charging LED, where the LED does not support pulsing in hardware and relies on a kernel (CPU) timer to implement the pulse capability. On these devices, pulsing the LED requires waking the CPU from suspend on every LED on/off event, substantially reducing the proportion of time the CPU can suspend, and thus, substantially increasing power consumption. Therefore, when the these devices reach the low battery threshold, their power consumption, ironically, increases measurably in order to pulse the battery charging LED, which lowers battery life and increases the likelihood of a low-battery shutdown if the user cannot charge the device in a timely fashion. This switch allows the user to disable the pulsing low battery LED in order to maximize their low battery charge.

Currently, most workqueues are bound to the CPU they were created on. This gives good performance (due to cache effects) at the cost of potentially waking up otherwise idle cores (Idle from scheduler's perspective. Which may or may not be physically idle) just to process some work. To save power, we can allow the work to be rescheduled on a core that is already awake. Workqueues created with the WQ_UNBOUND flag will allow some power savings. However, we don't change the default behaviour of the system. To enable power-saving behaviour, a new config option CONFIG_WQ_POWER_EFFICIENT needs to be turned on. This option can also be overridden by the workqueue.power_efficient boot parameter. tj: Updated config description and comments.

However, this doesn't matter here as user-space would need to poll() in two threads simultaneously to trigger this. And in this case it doesn't matter if a cached result is returned or the exact new result as user-space does not know which thread returns first from poll() and the following read(). So it is safe to compare the values without locking.

This allows us to extend the event structure and still keep backwards compatibility. If user-space wants to get multiple events in one syscall, they should use the readv()/writev() syscalls which are supported by uhid. This introduces a new lock which helps us synchronizing simultaneous reads from user-space. We also correctly return -EINVAL/-EFAULT only on errors and retry the read() when some other thread captured the event faster than we did.

Because we discard feature-requests silently, we must make sure to match a response to the corresponding request. We use sequence-IDs for this so user-space must copy the ID from the request into the answer. Feature-answers are ignored if they do not contain the same ID as the currently pending feature request.

When we have a page fault for the address which is backed by a hugepage under migration, the kernel can't wait correctly and do busy looping on hugepage fault until the migration finishes. As a result, users who try to kick hugepage migration (via soft offlining, for example) occasionally experience long delay or soft lockup. This is because pte_offset_map_lock() can't get a correct migration entry or a correct page table lock for hugepage. This patch introduces migration_entry_wait_huge() to solve this.

This transient swap_map state is expected to be transitory, but the actual placement of discard at scan_swap_map() inserts a wait for I/O completion thus making the thread at read_swap_cache_async() to loop around its -EEXIST case, while the other end at get_swap_page() is scheduled away at scan_swap_map(). This can leave the system deadlocked if the I/O completion happens to be waiting on the CPU waitqueue where read_swap_cache_async() is busy looping and !CONFIG_PREEMPT. This patch introduces a cond_resched() call to make the aforementioned read_swap_cache_async() busy loop condition to bail out when necessary, thus avoiding the subtle race window.

Specifically they seem to not be able to cope with a 4x pixel mutliplier instead of a 2x one, which seems to have been worked around by slightly changing the panels native mode in the VBT so that the dotclock is just barely above 50MHz. Since it took forever to notice the breakage it's fairly safe to assume that at least for SDVO-LVDS panels the VBT contains fairly sane data. So just switch around the order and use VBT modes first. v2: Also add EDID modes just in case, and spell Egbert correctly. v3: Elaborate a bit more about what's going on on Chris' machine.

Almost all the DMA issues which have plagued ath9k (in station mode) for years are related to PS. Disabling PS usually ""fixes"" the user's connection stablility. Reports of DMA problems are still trickling in and are sitting in the kernel bugzilla. Until the PS code in ath9k is given a thorough review, disbale it by default. The slight increase in chip power consumption is a small price to pay for improved link stability. Signed-off-by: Sujith Manoharan <c_manoha@qca.qualcomm.com> Signed-off-by: John W.

Doing so can help machines that require boot cpu be the last alive cpu during reboot to survive with kernel restart. This fixes one reboot issue seen on imx6q (Cortex-A9 Quad). The machine requires that the restart routine be run on the primary cpu rather than secondary ones. Otherwise, the secondary core running the restart routine will fail to come to online after reboot.

WORK_STRUCT_PENDING is used to claim ownership of a work item and process_one_work() releases it before starting execution. When someone else grabs PENDING, all pre-release updates to the work item should be visible and all updates made by the new owner should happen afterwards. Grabbing PENDING uses test_and_set_bit() and thus has a full barrier; however, clearing doesn't have a matching wmb. Given the preceding spin_unlock and use of clear_bit, I don't believe this can be a problem on an actual machine and there hasn't been any related report but it still is theretically possible for clear_pending to permeate upwards and happen before work->entry update.

This RFC assumes that the sequence number counters are always up to date. However, this is not true if an async crypto algorithm is employed. If the sequence number counters are not up to date on sequence number check, we may incorrectly update the upper 32 bit of the sequence number. This leads to a DOS. We workaround this by comparing the upper sequence number, (used for authentication) with the upper sequence number computed after the async processing. We drop the packet if these numbers are different. To do this, we introduce a recheck function that does this check in the ESN case.

Signed-off-by: Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer <markus@oberhumer.com> Proportional Rate Reduction for TCP. This patch implements Proportional Rate Reduction (PRR) for TCP. PRR is an algorithm that determines TCP's sending rate in fast recovery. PRR avoids excessive window reductions and aims for the actual congestion window size at the end of recovery to be as close as possible to the window determined by the congestion control algorithm. PRR also improves accuracy of the amount of data sent during loss recovery. The patch implements the recommended flavor of PRR called PRR-SSRB (Proportional rate reduction with slow start reduction bound) and replaces the existing rate halving algorithm. PRR improves upon the existing Linux fast recovery under a number of conditions including: 1) burst losses where the losses implicitly reduce the amount of outstanding data (pipe) below the ssthresh value selected by the congestion control algorithm and, 2) losses near the end of short flows where application runs out of data to send. As an example, with the existing rate halving implementation a single loss event can cause a connection carrying short Web transactions to go into the slow start mode after the recovery. This is because during recovery Linux pulls the congestion window down to packets_in_flight+1 on every ACK. A short Web response often runs out of new data to send and its pipe reduces to zero by the end of recovery when all its packets are drained from the network. Subsequent HTTP responses using the same connection will have to slow start to raise cwnd to ssthresh. PRR on the other hand aims for the cwnd to be as close as possible to ssthresh by the end of recovery. A description of PRR and a discussion of its performance can be found at the following links: - IETF Draft: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mathis-tcpm-proportional-rate-reduction-01 - IETF Slides: http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/80/slides/tcpm-6.pdf http://tools.ietf.org/agenda/81/slides/tcpm-2.pdf - Paper to appear in Internet Measurements Conference (IMC) 2011: Improving TCP Loss Recovery Nandita Dukkipati, Matt Mathis, Yuchung Cheng Signed-off-by: Nandita Dukkipati <nanditad@google.com> Signed-off-by: David S.

Its main features are: - auto cpu hotplugging based on runnable thread average calculations - detection of browsing mode (long screen on activities with moderate run queue depth =< 45 ) - limit max frequencies when in browsing mode to conserve battery for long duration tasks Browsing State Determination: 1- Browsing state is enabled as power-on default. Browsing state is disabled when run queue depth is > 45 (very high instantaneous spikes) Browsing State Limit Max Freq Logic (sliding window algorithm): 1- While Screen is ON > 3 min, and average load of the CPU is < 35%, then CPU Max frequencies will remain power-on default 2- While Screen is On, if average CPU load > 35%, both CPUs max frequencies will be limited to a lower user configurable max value 3- While Screen is On, After both CPUs' Max is limited to lowered max, when the average CPU load has dropped down to less than < 25%, then both CPUs Max freq will be restored to back to power-on default Runnable Thread Auto-hotplug (fast hotplug / slow unplug algorithm): 1- When average number of running thread is < threshold, 2nd cpu will be unplugged. 2- When > threshold, 2nd cpu will be hotplugged. 3- The logic applies a fast hotplug and slow unplug algorithm so 2nd core will stay enabled longer to help deal with performance spikes changes from Ver 2.0 -> Ver 3.0: - remove GPU Busy dependency for browsing state detection (this will make the governor more portable to other platforms without specific GPU architecture knowledge) dependencies: -- Qualcomm's run queue average logic (SOC independent logic) -- TI's runnable thread average logic (SOC independent logic) adapted for use on Samsung Galaxy S3 series Signed-off-by: Paul Reioux <reioux@gmail.com> Conflicts: arch/arm/mach-msm/cpufreq.c intellidemand: add bug fixes - Fix crash input event handler on governor switch - Fix panic when setting sampling rate Signed-off-by: faux123 <reioux@gmail.com> intellidemand: Add boost pulse capability Boost pulse increases UI performance by increasing CPU freq and reduce sampling time.

If it doesn't do this in a timely manner, the request is discarded silently. We serialize the feature requests, that is, there is always only a single active feature-request sent to user-space, other requests have to wait. HIDP and USB-HID do it the same way. Because we discard feature-requests silently, we must make sure to match a response to the corresponding request. We use sequence-IDs for this so user-space must copy the ID from the request into the answer. Feature-answers are ignored if they do not contain the same ID as the currently pending feature request. Internally, we must make sure that feature-requests are synchronized with UHID_DESTROY and close() events. We must not dead-lock when closing the HID device, either, so we have to use separate locks.

However, there is currently no driver that causes this so we are safe.

cphelps76,DEMENTED_kernel_jf,"cpuidle: Quickly notice prediction failure in general case The prediction for future is difficult and when the cpuidle governor prediction fails and govenor possibly choose the shallower C-state than it should. How to quickly notice and find the failure becomes important for power saving. The patch extends to general case that prediction logic get a small predicted residency, so it choose a shallow C-state though the expected residency is large . Once the prediction will be fail, the CPU will keep staying at shallow C-state for a long time. Acutally, the CPU has change enter into deep C-state. So when the expected residency is long enough but governor choose a shallow C-state, an timer will be added in order to monitor if the prediction failure. When C-state is waken up prior to the adding timer, the timer will be cancelled initiatively. When the timer is triggered and menu governor will quickly notice prediction failure and re-evaluates deeper C-states possibility.

Currently those GPIOs are configured in active mode once driver's probe() is called and configured in suspend mode once its remove() is called. Probe() is called once only and remove is not called until UARTDM platform device is removed. With this current implementation, although external device (ex. Bluetooth SoC) is not operational mode, used UARTDM GPIOs are configured in active mode which is causing more leakage current and more power consumption.

The issue does not show up if we are not in scan window.

dannomac,freebsd,"Bring over some initial power save management support, reset path fixes and beacon programming / debugging into the ath(4) driver. The basic power save tracking: * Add some new code to track the current desired powersave state; and * Add some reference count tracking so we know when the NIC is awake; then * Add code in all the points where we're about to touch the hardware and push it to force-wake. Then, how things are moved into power save: * Only move into network-sleep during a RUN->SLEEP transition; * Force wake the hardware up everywhere that we're about to touch the hardware. The net80211 stack takes care of doing RUN<->SLEEP<->(other) state transitions so we don't have to do it in the driver. Next, when to wake things up: * In short - everywhere we touch the hardware. * The hardware will take care of staying awake if things are queued in the transmit queue(s); it'll then transit down to sleep if there's nothing left. This way we don't have to track the software / hardware transmit queue(s) and keep the hardware awake for those. Then, some transmit path fixes that aren't related but useful: * Force EAPOL frames to go out at the lowest rate. This improves reliability during the encryption handshake after 802.11 negotiation. Next, some reset path fixes! * Fix the overlap between reset and transmit pause so we don't transmit frames during a reset. * Some noisy environments will end up taking a lot longer to reset than normal, so extend the reset period and drop the raise the reset interval to be more realistic and give the hardware some time to finish calibration. * Skip calibration during the reset path. Tsk! Then, beacon fixes in station mode! * Add a _lot_ more debugging in the station beacon reset path. This is all quite fluid right now. * Modify the STA beacon programming code to try and take the TU gap between desired TSF and the target TU into account. (Lifted from QCA.)
